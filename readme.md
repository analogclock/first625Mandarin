When asked, select that terms are separated by newline and fields are separated by comma. Be aware that my cards have three fields and many platforms only support two fields, so the second field will have two terms in it, e.g. pinyin and english.

# RECOMMENDED USE
In my experience so far, the joy and challenge of Mandarin is how different it is from English. There are a lot of dimensions to learn and remember, not limited to the sounds, the characters, and the translation. There are lots of ways to study, and I'm not one to tell you what to do. Nevertheless, I will describe what I've been doing and found effective.

First, if you are new to mandarin, study the sounds and radicals. It may feel like a waste of time but it will help greatly later. Then you will be ready for these cards.

For these cards, I have a multifaceted approach: 
1. Study first using the characters as the cue and the pinyin and translation on the back, with sound on.
2. Studying with the translation on the front and then characters and pinyin on the back, sound on so I can reinforce hearing it correctly. 
3. Characters on the front with the sound off. Practice rendering as pinyin and also the translation
